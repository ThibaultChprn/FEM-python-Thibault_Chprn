# FEM-python-Thibault_Chprn

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of Finite Element Analysis to carry out structural analysis tasks. These include computing the deformed configuration of a system under a given excitation, calculating reaction and section forces, and visualizing the stresses along the structure.
The code is largely based on the Method of Finite Elements I course, taught at ETH Zurich by Prof. Chatzi.
The implementation includes truss and beam elements along with two-dimensional plane stress elements (triangles and quadrilaterals).

The background literature and additional material on ABAQUS and FEM theory are included in the polybox repository above. 

## Next Short-Term Steps:
- ABAQUS 3D model for cantilever structure with solid elements. Perform modal analysis and obtain modeshapes.
- ABAQUS or Python model for cantilever structure with Euler-Bernoulli beam elements. Perform modal analysis and obtain modeshapes.
- Study Chapters 9-12 from Chopra's book and Chapter 31 from Felipa on dynamics. Focus on modal analysis and results interpretation.
- Study Fernando's paper [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-47717-2_36) (Also shared in Slack)
- Start implementing the visualization of the modeshapes for the simple cantilever model in Unity

## Next Long-Term Steps:
- Visualize modeshapes for the 3D example in Unity
- Start working with the mixed reality toolkit in the Mixed-Reality-Headset (to be bought)
