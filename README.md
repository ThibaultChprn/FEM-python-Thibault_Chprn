# FEM-python-Thibault_Chprn

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of Finite Element Analysis to carry out structural analysis tasks. These include computing the deformed configuration of a system under a given excitation, calculating reaction and section forces, and visualizing the stresses along the structure.
The code is largely based on the Method of Finite Elements I course, taught at ETH Zurich by Prof. Chatzi.
The implementation includes truss and beam elements along with two-dimensional plane stress elements (triangles and quadrilaterals).
