# FEM-python-Thibault_Chprn

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of Finite Element Analysis to carry out structural analysis tasks. These include computing the deformed configuration of a system under a given excitation, calculating reaction and section forces, and visualizing the stresses along the structure.
The code is largely based on the Method of Finite Elements I course, taught at ETH Zurich by Prof. Chatzi.
The implementation includes truss and beam elements along with two-dimensional plane stress elements (triangles and quadrilaterals).

## Material repository:

https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/el24YlfFv2FGCYV

The background literature and additional material on ABAQUS and FEM theory are included in the polybox repository above. 

## Next Steps:

- Familiarize with existing code template and study existing case studies
- Beam Elements: Compute stresses
- 2D Elements: Compute stresses
- ABAQUS: Familiarize with existing tutorials and case studies
- ABAQUS: Structural analysis on example system (to be defined)
