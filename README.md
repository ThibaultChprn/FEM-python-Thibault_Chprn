# FEM-python-Thibault_Chprn

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of Finite Element Analysis to carry out structural analysis tasks. These include computing the deformed configuration of a system under a given excitation, calculating reaction and section forces, and visualizing the stresses along the structure.
The code is largely based on the Method of Finite Elements I course, taught at ETH Zurich by Prof. Chatzi.
The implementation includes truss and beam elements along with two-dimensional plane stress elements (triangles and quadrilaterals).

## Material repository:

The background literature and additional material on ABAQUS and FEM theory are included in the polybox repository above. 

## Next Steps:
- Create a graphical abstract or a summary in the form of a presentation slide. This summary should describe all steps involved when performing a structural analysis of an engineering system using Finite Elements. The respective graph or slide should function as the introductory slide on the progress presentation to be scheduled. Thus, it should describe in short, not only the steps but also the processes and details involved that you have familiarized yourself with.
- Decide for a system of interest to perform a structural analysis on. 
- ABAQUS: Familiarize with existing tutorials and case studies
- ABAQUS: Structural analysis on example system (to be defined)
- Compare ABAQUS results with python template results
